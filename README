This workflow is designed to set up a geometrically realistic 3D subduction zone geometry.

The general steps are to run the following scripts:

    1. generate_points.sh: define node coordinates and labels
    2. generate_lines.sh: connect nodes with lines
    3. generate_surfaces: connect lines into surfaces
    4. setup_gmsh.sh: convert the geometry into a form readable by Gmsh
